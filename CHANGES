	--- Advanced Research Corporation

Changes   03/09/94
-------

Fix to ./scripts/sub/check_embed.  This was disabling the
check_embedded script.

New Stuff  01/06/94
---------

Updated signature files for SunOS 4.x and SunOS 5.x.

Bug fixes...

If the current directory is a descendant of a directory for which the
user does not have 'read' permissions (i.e., search only), then csh
and find do not always work.  Workaround is to 'cd /' where necessary.
Not sure this has been completely implemented.

typo in scripts/sub/check_devs (Multiple people)

scripts/sub/check_devs exited if GENCLIENTDIRS undefined (Sally Noonan).

-x 'test' switch is not portable. (Sally Noonan)

AIX doesn't need '-g' (Dorian Deane)

IRIX test doesn't shortcircuit (Steve Rikli)

IRIX config had wrong definition for DATECMD and TIMECMD (Steve Rikli)

Crude 'smrsh' check performing poorly (Patrick Nolan & Mohamed el Lozy)

Changes for performance and robustness, as suggested by Goran
Larsson.  A C program is used to get file ownership and permissions
instead of 'ls | awk'.  (If the C program won't compile, we fall
back to 'ls | awk'.

Changes to check_anonftp for performance.

Added -c switch to allow specifying alternate 'tigerrc' script (John Reynolds)

'tigexp' loses command line parameters on NeXT 3.0 (Kelly Cunningham)

Added ethernet device files to check list for SunOS 5 (was already there
in SunOS 4).  Also inspects /var/sadm/install/contents to check the
perms there so that they don't get accidentally changed back.

New Stuff  10/31/93
---------

Mailling list available.  See the README file for more information.

Support for TAMU Linux distribution, may work on other Linux' as well.

Updated signatures for SunOS 4.x & SunOS 5.x for security patches.

'installsig' script for installing new signature files (util/installsig).
We will try to maintain up to date security patch signature files in
the directory net.tamu.edu:/pub/security/TAMU/tiger-sigs.  Note that
at present, only SunOS 4.x and SunOS 5.x are being actively maintained
(not that there is a bias here, it is just easier for me to get information
on these... contributions will be welcomed).

Various minor bug fixes relating to various platforms.

Fixed check_suid to handle MD5 signatures.

check_embedded now will optionally wait for the file system scans to
complete and will check all setuid executables found for "bad"
embedded pathnames.  See 'tigerrc' for configuring details.

New Stuff  08/17/93
---------

Script for checking embedded pathnames.  The other scripts collect
filenames which are then fed into the check_embedded script.  This
checks the ownership and permissions of all of these embedded pathnames.
Be warned... this can generate *lots* of output.

Pathname checking is now much more complete.  Every "problem" is
reported in detail, instead of saying "Hey, there's a problem with
this pathname".

'tigercron' should work a lot better now.

Script for checking BSD printcap printer control file.

Signatures for IRIX 4.0.5*, thanks to Steve Rikli.
Signatures for NeXTOS 3.1, thanks to William McVey, et al.

Cleaned up output... much of the output now gets formatted to (default)
80 columns.

Digital signature checking now works with SNEFRU or MD5.  Automagically
detects which signature to generate.

Signature checking is a lot faster now, especially if you have a
clean system (the signature database is ordered such that the
"good" signatures are first).

Interface to 'password' generator scripts changed so that the 
generator scripts can do sanity checking on the base files.  Interfaces
to all of the other generator scripts will be changed in next release.

Makefile for installing everything.  I'm not happy with the installation
process this time either... if anyone wants to contribute a snazzy
installation script I'll be happy to include it... 


New Stuff  06/17/93
---------

First off, there are some man pages in the 'man' directory.  They are
definitely lacking.  If I ever stop adding stuff to the package, maybe
I will be able to write better documentation.

********
Explain facility.  All messages (should) have a message ID associated
with them in square brackets [].  The script 'tigexp' can be used to
get an explanation of the message.  Some (many?) of the explanations
are lacking.  You can also insert the explanations into the output
of 'tiger' by using the '-e' flag.  If anyone has suggestions or
improved explanations, don't hesitate to send them to me.

********
Crack 4.1 interface.  'tiger' will now run Alec Muffett's password
cracker 'Crack'.  See the 'tigerrc' file and 'site-sample' file for
information on enabling it (it is disabled by default).

********
Systems:

SunOS 4.1.1 sun3, 4.1.1 sun4, 4.1.2, 4.1.3, 5.1, 5.2 sun4
NeXT 3.0

There, but untested (and I do mean untested).  You can try them,
but they have *never* been used, so I have no idea what to expect.
Some parts are missing (i.e., no signature files).

AIX 3.x (if this one works... any idea why so many setuid's on AIX 3?)
HPUX (probably anything up to 9.x)
IRIX 4.x
UNICOS 6.x 7.x (if those pesky users didn't use the machine so much...)

********
More checks.  A few of the additions since the last release are:

check_aliases:  Check mail aliases for problems.
check_cron:  Check 'cron' entries for problems.
check_group:  Cross reference 'group' files for problems.
check_passwd:  Cross reference 'passwd' files for problems.
check_path:  Check 'root' (and optionally all users) PATH for problems.

In addition all previous scripts have been beefed up with many more
checks.  File Permission databases have been improved (though they
still need more work).  Scripts which check the path to executables
and files now check the pathname thoroughly, even in the face of
symbolic links.

The file system scans now report device files, world writable
directories, symbolic links to system files, in addition to setuid
executables.  Also the setuid checks now attempt to determine if a
setuid program is an old version of a binary for which a security
patch was released (i.e., it was moved out of the way, but never
deleted or chmod'd, and hence may still be a security problem).

For servers of diskless or dataless clients, some "quick" checks of
the clients can be performed on the server (see man/tiger.man).  Not
everything can be checked.  Plus, support is not complete.

It is possible to install 'tiger' now so that you don't have to
feed it all the names of the directories on each invocation.
Just run 'Install'... it will prompt for names.

'tigercron' provides a simple-cron facility with report differencing
capability and mailing of reports.  This is just started and needs
more work to be really useful.  See the 'cronrc' file for a sample
input to it.

Checks for the availability of a utility commands have been moved
nearer to where they are actually needed (as opposed to having them
at the top of each script).  This enables more checks to be performed
when only a few commands are missing.

All cleanup of scratch files goes through the 'delete' routine which
won't delete a file that isn't in the scratch work directory.  This
is to prevent programmer errors from zapping the wrong file [what?
programmer errors?  Never... :)]

Some more C code added.  Handling of obtaining a compilation of the
source improved.  For casual use, nothing need be done.  The C code
will be compiled and installed in the Bindir (TIGERHOME/bin by default).
For regular use, or use in a large group of systems, sharing the
tiger directories, the binaries can be compiled and stored in the
respective system directories.  The scripts will use the binary
directly from that directory.  The Solaris 2.x (SunOS 5) directory
provides precompiled binaries (no C compiler by default).

Finally, if you try to run this on a system with an old or broken
Bourne shell, or one without functions, have a peek at util/setsh.
This will change all the '#!' headers to some other shell (i.e. ksh or
bash).  Note that 'tiger' has never been run under either of these,
but it might be worth a shot.
