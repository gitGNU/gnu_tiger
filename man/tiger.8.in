.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
Tiger is a package consisting of Bourne Shell scripts, C code and
data files which is used for checking for security problems on a
UNIX system.  It scans system configuration files, file systems,
and user configuration files for possible security problems and
reports them.  The command
.BR tigexp (8)
can be used to obtain explanations of the problems reported by \fBtiger\fR.
.LP
You can configure
.B tiger
to your by adjusting the 
.B Tiger_
variables in the 
.I @tigerconfigdir@/tigerrc
configuration file. This configuration file specifies which module checks
(see
.B MODULES
below) are run through 
.B Tiger_Check
variables which can be either
.B Y
(run the check) or 
.B N
(do not run the check). Other configuration variables will modify the
behaviour of some modules, and should be adjusted based on the
operating system.
.LP
The 
.I @tigerconfigdir@/tiger.ignore
configuration file defines a set of messages that will not be presented
in the report even if any of the modules generate them.
If the file exists, all the entries (line by line) are used as extended
regular expressions that are compared against each message (notice that
it will introduce some overhead which grows with the size of the file).
For more information on this mechanism read the 
.I README.ignore
document.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
The following arguments can be used when calling the program:
.TP
.BI "\-B " tigerdir
Specify the directory where
.B tiger
is installed.  If not specified, @tigerhomedir@ is used.
.TP
.BI "\-l " logdir\fR|\fI@logserver
Specify the name of the directory where
.B tiger
will write the security report.  This defaults to @tigerlogdir@.
The filename of the report will
be of the form 'security.report.\fIhostname.date.time\fR'.
If the directory begins with a \fB@\fR, the name will
be interpreted as a tiger logging server.  Tiger logging's server
is currently a server that listens in port (tcp) 5353 on a remote
host.  The tiger process will just send the results to that server
using a telnet connection.
.TP
.BI "\-w " workdir
Specify a directory to use for creating scratch files.  This defaults
to \fI@tigerworkdir@\fR.
.TP
.BI "\-b " bindir
Specify the directory which contains (or will contain) the binaries
generated from the C modules.  If the systems directories contain
all the binaries, they will be used directly from there.  If not,
then if
.I bindir
contains the binaries, these will be used.  If none are found in
either place, then an attempt will be made to compile the C code
and install the executables into \fIbindir\fR.
.TP
.BI "\-c " tigerrc
Specify an alternate name for the
.I tigerrc
control file.  The default is '@tigerconfigdir@/tigerrc'.
.TP
.B "\-e"
This option will cause explanations to be inserted into the security
report following each message.  This can greatly increase the size
of the report, as explanations may appear repeatedly.
.TP
.B "\-E"
This option indicates that a separate explanation report should be
created, with explanations for each type of message only appearing
once.  The filename of the explanation report will be of the
form 'explain.report.\fIhostname.date.time\fR'.
.TP
.B "\-G"
Generate the signatures (MD5 hashes and file permissions)
for system binary files.
.TP
.B "\-H"
This option will format the report into HTML creating local links
to the problem descriptions.
.TP
.B "\-S"
This option indicates that a surface level check of the configuration
files of any diskless clients served by this machine should be checked
at the same time.  The checks will not be as in depth as they would be
if run on the client itself.
.TP
.B "\-q"
Suppress messages to be as quiet as possible, only
security messages will be shown.
.TP
.I "\-A arch"
This option overrides the default value obtained for the current architecture
detected by the internal configuration engine to a value defined
by the user.
.TP
.I "\-O os"
This option overrides the default value obtained for the current operating
system detected by the internal configuration engine to a value defined
by the user.
.TP
.I "\-R release"
This option overrides the default value obtained for the current 
operating system release detected by the internal configuration engine 
to a value defined by the user.
.LP
Notice that changing the real values for the operating system and
architecture 
.B Tiger
is running in might result in scripts being run which are not
appropiate to it, and, as a consequence, unexpected (and potentially 
dangerous) errors might be generated. When executed
.B Tiger
will show which operating system, release and architecture thinks it is
running in.
.LP
.SH MODULES
.LP
.B Tiger
is composed of a series of modules. Each of these modules check specific
security issues related to UNIX systems.  The framework provided by
.B Tiger
allows the provision of both generic modules and those specific for
the operating system the software runs in. Modules can be executed
stand alone, from cron or through the
.B tiger
program (which will execute all those available).
.LP
If you want to write additional modules for your system read the
.I README.writemodules
document.
.LP
.B Tiger
currently provides the following modules:
.TP
.B check_accounts
Checks the accounts provided in the system, looking for disabled accounts
with cron, rhosts, .forward, and valid shells.
.TP
.B check_aliases
Performs a check for mail aliases and improper configuration.
.TP
.B check_anonftp
Determines if the anonymous FTP service is properly configured.
.TP
.B check_cron
Validates the cron entries in the system.
.TP
.B check_embedded
Determines if embedded pathnames are configured properly.
.TP
.B check_exports
Analyses configuration files for NFS exported filesystems to see if 
access is properly restricted.
.TP
.B check_group
Checks the UNIX groups available in the system, looking for conflicts
and improper entries.
.TP
.B check_inetd
Checks the inetd configuration file: compares against services 
definition, valid directory paths, non-existent binaries and active
services.
.TP
.B check_known
Looks for known intrusion signs including backdoors and mail spools.
.TP
.B check_netrc
Checks if users's netrc files are insecurely configured.
.TP
.B check_nisplus
Looks for wrong configuration in the NIS+ entries.
.TP
.B check_passwd
Checks the UNIX users available in the system, looking for conflicts
and improper entries.
.TP
.B check_path
Validates the binaries in user's PATHs as well as PATH definitions
used by scripts in order to determine insecure definitions.
.TP
.B check_perms
Check filepermissions and inconsistencies.
.TP
.B check_printcap
Analyses the configuration for the printer control file.
.TP
.B check_rhosts
Checks rhosts files in order to see if user's configuration leaves the
system open to attack.
.TP
.B check_sendmail
Checks sendmail configuration files.
.B check_signatures
Compares binary files signatures against those stored in the local database
(provided with the program).
.TP
.B check_system
This module calls the operating system's specific modules available at
\fB/usr/lib/tiger/systems/\fR.
.TP
.B check_apache
Checks the
.B Apache
configuration file and reports on generic issues which might introduce
exposures or vulnerabilities in the system.
.TP
.B check_devices
Checks for devices's permissions, warning about devices that have world
permissions.
.TP
.B check_exrc
Analyses .exrc files that are not in user's home directories. The \fBvi\fR
command will look for the existence of such a file in the current
directory, and so may inadvertently perform commands that can
compromise your system's security when starting \fBvi\fR or \fBex\fR.
.TP
.B check_finddeleted
Checks if deleted files are being used by any process in the current 
system. This might be an indication of intrusion (a user executing
processes and then deleting its files) or of unpatched servers
(which, if not restarted use old library files and are still 
vulnerable).
.TP
.B check_ftpusers
Analyses the system's /etc/ftpusers and determines if the administrative
users are in that file.
.TP
.B check_issue
Checks the /etc/issue and /etc/issue.net file to determine if they
contain the appropriate content (this is defined in the ISSUEFILE and
ISSUENETFILE).
.TP
.B check_logfiles
Checks for the existence of log files (wtmp, btmp, lastlog and utmp).  It
will also check for proper umask settings.
.TP
.B check_lilo
Analyses configuration files for lilo and grub boot loaders (Linux-specific).
.TP
.B check_listeningprocs
Checks for processes listening on TCP/IP sockets (servers) in the system as 
well as users running them. Will warn if the user running a server is not 
an authorised one or if the server is listening on all available interfaces.
.TP
.B check_passwdformat
Checks the format of the /etc/passwd file in order to
determine inconsistencies which indicate an intrusion or misconfiguration.
.TP
.B check_patches
Checks if patches are available for the system (i.e. new packages).
It will use autorpm or apt\-get to check this (so this tools need to be
properly configured). This check is specific to Linux (RedHat or Debian).
.TP
.B check_root
Checks if remote root login is allowed to the local system.
.TP
.B check_rootdir
Checks the permissions for the root directory.
.TP
.B check_rootkit
Tries to find systems which have been rootkited, it does so by
looking for trojaned \fBls\fR and \fBfind\fR commands.
It also includes a wrapper to run the \fBchkrootkit\fR program 
and format the results in Tiger's message format.
.TP
.B check_single
Checks if the system is properly configured to disallow single-user
access. This check is specific to Linux.
.TP
.B check_release
Analyses the version of the operating system and determines if it is
too out of date. This check is specific to Linux (RedHat or Debian).
.TP
.B check_runprocs
This module will check if the processes configured in 
.I tigerrc
are running currently in the system. If any of the processes
is not running,
.B Tiger
will warn the administrator (this acts as a lightweight software watchdog)
.TP
.B check_services
Check which services are configured in the system (usually in
/etc/services) versus the ones that should be configured (in the
provided services file)
.TP
.B check_tcpd
Tests for the existence of tcp\-wrappers and changes in their configuration
it also determines which services are running wrapped in tcp\-wrappers.
.TP
.B check_umask
Check for umask setting in configuration files.
.TP
.B check_xinetd
Checks which xinetd services are enabled or disabled.
.TP
.B crack_run
Runs a local installation of the \fBCrack\fR program which can be used
to determine if local user passwords are easy (or not) to guess.
.TP
\fBtripwire_run\fR \fBaide_run\fR \fBintegrit_run\fR
Wrappers for a number of integrity checkers, these programs enhance the
support of \fBTiger\fR for MD5 and SHA\-1 binary signatures and file
system permission checks (implemented with the the \fBcheck_perms\fR
and \fBcheck_signatures\fR scripts).  You should consider installing
any of these three programs (\fBTripwire\fR, \fBAide\fR or \fBIntegrit\fR)
and use read-only locations (such as CD-ROM) to store the hashes of the system.
.TP
.B deb_checkadvisories
This module checks against a list of stored Debian Security
Advisories in order to see if the system has any package installed
whose version might be subject to any security vulnerability (Debian-specific).
.TP
.B deb_checkmd5sums
Compares the MD5 sums of binary files against those provided after installation.
Changes in these files might be an indication of a compromised system
(Debian-specific).
.TP
.B deb_nopackfiles
Looks for files installed in the system's directories that are not provided
by any installed Debian packages (Debian-specific).
.LP
