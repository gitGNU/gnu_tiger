# check_ftpusers - jfs -  Sat May 18 18:39:35 CEST 2002
# 
# Analyses the system's /etc/ftpusers and determines if the administrative
# users are in that file.
#
# 03/31/2005 jfs Allow FTPUSERS to be customised (some OS have it
#                in alternate locations)
# 10/01/2003 jfs Removed passwd files if not used any longer.
#
# 07/25/2002 jfs Added a sanity check for password files.
#                Changed TigerInstallDir to .
#
# 05/18/2002 jfs Created based on check_root with ideas inspired on Titan's
#		 modules/ftpusers.sh
#
# 08/09/2002 jfs Fixed call to grep adding quotes (now works in Solaris)
