  * Use tempfile in the config script to create the RC file if available, the
    $$ construct is used in a safe directory (WORKDIR) but this way people
    doing a cursory look at the code will not report (or try to fix, as in
    Ubuntu) inexistant temp race conditions.
  * Add code in Makefile.in and doc/Makefile.in (new file) to make it possible
    to build and remove the HTML files generated from the text files so that
    we do not distributed autogenerated content.
  * Also change Makefile.in to make 'all' actually be useful so that the build
    targets builds binaries (binaries were being built on install instead)
  * Update list of Debian advisories to current date.
  * Add a ignore for Debian to prevent Tiger from complaining about fetchmail
    processes.
  * Add additional samples for server processes to debian/server.ignore

  * Updated advisories

  * Fixed eval in check_accounts so that find is _only_ executed for users
    which are not part of Tiger_Admin_Accounts, this prevents Tiger from
    going and using remote filesystems (i.e. /var/autofs/ because in
    Debian 'operator' has /var as his home dir). It also should speed
    up this check a lot. This shows why Tiger_Admin_Accounts is a bad
    idea and Tiger_Accounts_Trust should be used instead (or add a
    Tiger_Accounts_Admin) (Closes: #280653, #280654)

    situations)
    (Closes: #246987)
    - [check_passwd] Define Tiger_Passwd_Hashes if not defined
    (Closes: #246885)
    - [deb_checkmd5sums] Fixed patch provided by Chung-chieh Shan
    (Closes: #234811)

  * Remove check_finddeleted from the default configuration since it 
    is prone to a lot of false positives, also, it depends on LSOF
    (which is only recommended). I will reenable this sometime in
    the future and (maybe) provide a Debian-specific script to just
    monitor for daemons that are using outdated libraries 
    (Closes: #249331)
  * Send filesystem scans error output to /dev/null (need to fix this
    in scripts/find_files by not following symbolic links that point

tiger (1:3.2.1-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated from CVS which includes a number of improvements including
    the following (relevant to Debian bugs):
      - Added more information on check_finddeleted regarding 
       how to use it and remove spurious errors. This script
       will not give false positives any longer on some special
       characterr) files like /dev/console or /dev/null and has
       reduced its output to something more managable (there is
       only one message per deleted file now)
       (Closes: #232704,#231148, #225112)
      - Fixed password definitions adding the 'g-Z' 'A-Z' and
      '.' sets (Closes: #227596) 
      - Many scripts now controls YPCAT errors to printing errors in
        hosts that are not properly configured.  
        (i.e. nsswitch.conf is defined to use NIS but there's no NIS
        host) Errors are redirected to /dev/null when YPCAT is not 
        required as many systems do not include it, specially in Debian.
        (Closes: #225910)
      - Check_crontab will only warn if neither cron.allow
        or cron.deny exist (Debian bug #226362)
  * Default cronrc no longer runs check_finddeleted as often since it's
    prone to false positives (even if it can be customised through the
    ignore mechanism, see /usr/share/doc/tiger/examples/server.ignore)
  * Added French template translation provided by Christian Perrier
    (Closes: #226883, #224700)
  * Fully translated the spanish template.
  * Updated to include latest Debian advisories.
  * debian/rules now uses mandir (/usr/share/man/) in configure call.

    * check_crontabs adds more information in messages
    * check_inetd does not report the services as not protected if 
      TCP wrappers are undefined
    * per interface promiscuous detection with 'ip' for more accurate
      results in check_known
    * check_passwd message fix

  * Automatically remove CVS dirs from the package (Closes: #154343)
  * Fixed bashisms in check_rcumask (Closes: #159444)

tiger (3.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed Linux' config file so that it sets LSGROUPS to nothing
  Due to a change in fileutils-4.1.1 which changed the standard
  behavior from "showing groups (but really doing nothing)" to
  "not showing the owner" ! (Closes: #155588)
  * Modified config to set the environment properly (this was the
  first workaround I tried for the previous bug, didn't fix it but
  it seems better to leave the locale's environment, just in case...)

tiger (3.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (based on savannah sources)
  * Fix in order for deb_checkmd5sums to work with all sources (it was
    limited due to a stupid bug)
  * Included latest DSA advisories
  * The new package provides a *very* short diff since changes regarding
  Debian are added to the upstream sources too.

tiger (2.2.4p2-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a GPL header to all the important scripts/files used by the
    program (this means /, /scripts and /systems/{default,Linux}.
    This was a requirement for adding tiger as a new project to the
    savannah site.
    (probably next upstream version and Debian diff file will be 
    reduced since I intend to make the current Debian codebase 
    upstream's 2.2.4p3)
  * Added a new check scripts/check_runprocs (not currently configured to
    run since it needs sysadmin to configure tigerrc properly to determine
    which processes should be checked for)
  * Added some more information to the README.Debian file and rewrote
    some paragraphs.
  * Written some notes on how to use Tiger as a host IDS.
  * Chmod'ed many scripts in order to avoid lintian warnings.
  * Changed tiger so it first reads tigerrc in the local directory 
  (useful for testing the package without installing or to use the tar.gz
  in other environments)
  * Fixed the scripts/check_anon in order to test if ftphome/etc/passwd
  exists before grep'ing it.

tiger (2.2.4p2-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Incorporated TARA changes including:
    - Changed acc006 from FAIL to WARN (scripts/check_accounts).
    - Added -H option for HTML output.
    - Fixed scripts/check_cron for problems in entries.
    - Fixed scripts/check_exports to avoid false positives.
    - Fixed scripts/check_path due to problems with parse_csh.
    - Change scripts/check_perm to not warn when owner is bin and 
      changed calls of echo to message().
    - Made some of the changes provided by ARC in scripts/check_inetd
     (save for the SORT and JOIN changes which do not seem to work)
    - Changed scripts/sub/check_devs to work with IRIX 6.5
    - Changed GROUPS to GROUPSS as ARC team does since it (might)
      be a readonly variable in some shells (see bash(1)). Even though
     it is not used in any script.
     
  * Created a new package to provide all the scripts for other operating
    systems (Warning: you still need to compile the C programs: getpermit,
    md5, realpath, snefru and testsuid in those platforms for tiger to work
    fully).
  * Added Tiger_Check_SYSTEM to the distributed tigerrc
  * Added some Linux specific checks (gdm, xdm) in scripts/check_root
  * Created (new) systems/Linux/2/check_inittab script (for ctraltdel issue
    from Bastille).
  * Created (new) systems/Linux/2/check_rcumask script to check umask settings
    for the RC boot scripts.
  * Created (new) scripts/check_ftpusers script to check for administrative
    users that are allowed access in the FTP server.
  * Created (new) scripts/check_tcpd script to check for changes in the
    way inetd services are being protected through the use of tcp_wrappers.
    This script has been written based on check_inetd.
  * Modified scripts/check_sendmail to check for sendmail.cf's banner
  * Note. This new scripts have not been added to the cron entry. They will 
    only be run when running the 'tiger' script.

  * Written some README files: howto write modules (README.writemodules),.
    how much time does it take for scripts to run (README.time), and
    information on making signatures (README.signatures)
  
  * Changed tigexp to work if issued -F with no second argument

  * Updated security advisories.

tiger (2.2.4p2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * This is the "I finally merged with Bryan Gartner's tarball" release
  * Cosmetic upgrade in version number due to too many changes in the
    sytem specific checks (AIX, Solaris et al.) derivated from tara sources.
    (thus this release might be labeled "new upstream", avoid 2.2.4p1 since
    it is used in TAMU's distribution)
  * Updated to latest debian DSAs.
  * Next release will have a new package to provide all the scripts for 
    other Operating systems so that a central Debian server can be used 
    with network filesystems as a single point of script distribution.
  * Included tara's new check and scripts checks: devices, issue, 
    lilo, logfiles, network, patches, release, root, rootdir, single and
    tripwire_run (this last one is deactivated in Debian since 
    the package, if installed, will do the checks)
  * Included the following systems without changes: AIX-4, IRIX-{4,5,6},
    Linux-1, Next-3, UNICOS, UNICOSMK
  * Instead of cp'ing all the SunOS files I ln -s all directories that
    were equal in order to reduce space in the source package (and diff)
  * Included the two new utils to convert into HTML
  * Changed realpath.c, snefru.c as described in CHANGES.ARSC
  * Merged patches from ASCR in files: check_accounts, check_cron, check_group,
    check_inetd, check_passwd, check_sendmail, systems/Linux/2/gen_mounts,
    tiger.
  * Updated scripts (not changed in Debian): check_path
  * Fixed Linux's gen_cron to include CRONSPOOL and fixed 
    systems/Linux/2/config to properly configure it (was set to /usr
    instead of /var) since it was not used this was not detected until now.
  * Updated the tiger configuration file (tigerrc)
  * Updated the manpage tiger.8
  * Moved check_listening from Linux-specific to all the generic location
    (since it will work in any UNIX system with NETSAT). 
    Changed tigerrc accordingly adding Tiger_Check_LISTENING variable
    and renaming the previous variables for this check.
  * De-activated RedHat's specific (and written in Perl) check_network
    script. TODO: rewrite it in shell script and remove RedHat-specific
    stuff.
  * Moved the Linux specific checks provided by Paul Telford to
    systems/Linux/2/ since they are not appropiate to other systems
    (for consistency)
  * Fixed check_release as provided by Paul Telford (some typos and not
    correctly programmed)
  * Applied some of the changes described in the Changes.ARSC. It seems these
    were not included in the TARA distribution (for some reason).
    REMINDER: ask for these to the ARSC team.
  * Fixed check_sendmail's pattern matching (wrong reports on dates) and made
    it properly Y2k.
  * Fixed (again) the postinst... let's see if I get it right this time...
  * Moved the FQDN check from 'tiger' to 'config' (since it is used by both
    tiger and tigercron)

tiger (2.2.4-22) unstable; urgency=low

  * This is the "Yes, I was on vacation fixing bugs release (I)"
  * Applied patch Marcel that fixes some long-standing issues, did not change
    BASEDIR to basedir since it should work that way but *did* change typo
    which made diff's against previous run not to work (Closes: #139221)
  * Fixed Linux/2/gen_export_sets tpo (Closes: #139667)
  * Modified Linux/2/config so that findcmd() looks first for binaries generated
    by Tiger, including realpath (Closes: #139669)
  * Modified deb_checkmd5sum to "understand" locale.nopurge configuration.
    Currently experimental, but seems to work fine. Admins that fixed this
    through templates will, however, have to remake them (Closes: #123891)
  * Since realpath's Linux does not work as tiger's realpath -d, removed it
    from the Recommends: (use tiger's instead)
  * Added -u option in gen_listeningprocs (UDP sockets are not shown if using
    netstat, this was an unreported bug)
  * Added warning to the tigerrc regarding user's Tiger_ListeningProc (will
    not work if using NETSTAT and not LSOF)
  * Added the Tiger_Check_EVERYLISTENING option which will report if a
    service is listening on *all* interfaces, default is Y, if set to 'N'
    only processes run by users different from Tiger_ListeningProcs will be
    reported. Changed gen_listeningprocs for this to work (Closes: #138855)
  * Changed the name of gen_listeningprocs to check_listeningprocs (more
    proper and consistent)
  * Provided some more documentation in the tiger.8 manpage detailing which
    modules are available
  * Check_listeningprocs has been modified to allow it to not warn on
    processes when using the Tiger_Listening_ValidProc variable in 
    /etc/tigerrc this allows admins to remove processes which can dynamically
    change TCP/IP port (Closes: #134085)
  * Changed Tiger_Listening_Proc to Tiger_Listening_ValidUser (more precise).
    WARNING: Postinst will not change this from the config file! 
  * The changes introduced in check_listeningprocs as well as the 
    check-against-template behavior configuration will (hopefully) reduce greatly 
    false positives if properly configured (Closes: #126635)
  * Set Tiger_Check_CRACK to 'N' by default and removed cron job since this 
    feature does not work. Added 'john' Recommends: since the Debian package
    does provide that feature by itself.
  * Added check_sendmail to SCRIPTS in the Makefile (it was not being
    installed, unreported bug)

  system's passwords (Closes: #135205)
  * Added proper dependecies (based on systems/Linux/2/config) 
  (Closes: #128796)
  * Added an Tiger_Output_FQDN option so that it uses hostname -f
  as the system name for reports (Closes: #129526)

  the current Tiger version.

tiger (2.2.4-18) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed the deb_nopackfiles so it uses -x -F and will not be confused by
  strange file names (i.e. [) this also avoids filenames being interpreted
  as regular expressions (Closes: #126569)
  * Fixed deb_md5sums so it does not follow symlinks (sometimes they get
  followed to unexistant files)
  * Modified check_accounts so that it does not give warnings for accounts
  of uid < 999 (system accounts in Debian GNU/Linux) by introducing a new
  tigerrc variable (Tiger_Accounts_Trust)
  * Added tiger-2.2.3p1-patch from TAMU
  * Added some more info to the debian/copyright file
  * Added the fix_tiger_GROUPS.sh script to a "contrib" area
  * Added -p option to netstat and reduced output with grep -v STREAM :)
  * Improved gen_listeningprocs so only uniq processes are shown listening
  to the same socket, also, UDP sockets are now listed too with lsof and
  netstat
  * Fixed check_inetd so it does not do a 'set' when an empty line is found
  * Modified difflogs intensively since it was not working properly, added
  a new feature and varialbes in tigerrc so that cron jobs can be compared
  against "template" (policy-compliant?) runs. This can reduce false positives
  even if they cannot be reduced in a given module.
  * Added configurable Tiger_Listening_Procs for gen_listeningprocs to 
  customize for local security policy (Closes: #126635)
  * Added debconf note (borrowed from snort) to configure mails receiver
  (Closes: #122256)
  * Added debconf note to warn the user to adapt to security policy
  * Fixed lintian errors.
  * Update DSAs

  * Added -rf to prerm script when purging.

tiger (2.2.4-15) unstable; urgency=low

 -- Javier Fernandez-Sanguino Pen~a <jfs@computer.org>  Thu, 20 Dec 2001 10:33:16 +0100

tiger (2.2.4-14) unstable; urgency=high

  * Updated the services file and modified the check_inetd scripts so now it

  (Closes: #122391)
  * Updated services file (Closes: #122338)
  * Fixed file control list (Closes: #122337)
  * Updated Debian Security Advisories

  non-optimize method (using grep, cut, et al in the /var/lib/dpkg area)
  * Fixed Debian specific scripts (==)
  * Fixed Linux's gen_export_sets (nobody yelled yet, but it did not work
  in the previous release)

tiger (2.2.4-11) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Changed file_access_list for Linux so /etc/aliases can be world readable (Closes: #112159)
  * Fixed getuserhome command so it does not return directories beginning 
  with ~. This fixes tiger from incorrectly guessing the ftp directory 
  (Closes: #121800, #114008)

  * Changed the postrm script so all files are removed on purge (Closes: #116267)
  * Changed MAILER from mail to sendmail so we can send 'Subject' and 'From' 
  (Closes: #120679, #121681)
  * Fixed tigercron so mails get sent properly with a From line, since the
  information is now sent to the mailer and not to the Tiger log no 
  mails should be sent out if they do not include useful information 
  (tiger takes care of diffing out reports) (Closes: #114334, #113588)
  * Added Recommends on mail transport agent since it's used for cron reporting.
  * Fixed gen_export_sets for Linux so it properly warns when using
  Linux's /etc/exports
  * Added a tag in tigerrc to disable reporting when nothing important
  happens (Closes: #113588)
  * Changed check_passwd so it now says how many times uids or usernames
  appear repeated (Closes: #117117)
