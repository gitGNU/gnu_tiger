Aide detected, by checking against the files' the attributes in the database,
the file has changed. "Benign" actions, like accessing a file (remember 
directories are files too) may have changed it, but it may be part of a breach
of security. Please investigate.
%aide004w
Aide detected, by checking against the files' the attributes in the database,
the file has been removed. "Benign" configuration errors of the database 
settings may lead to incorporation and checking of for instance temporary 
files. Uninstalling software and related files may lead to the same result 
when the database was not upgraded before this check.
If the removed file was not a temporary file and not part of legitimately
uninstalled software, it may have been used in a breach of security.
Please investigate.
%aide005w
Aide detected, by checking file against the database, the file was not part of 
the database. "Benign" actions like installing software and related files or 
changes in the configuration file may lead to this result when the database 
was not upgraded before this check. If the removed file was not part of 
legitimately installed software, it may be in use in a breach of security. 
Please investigate.
