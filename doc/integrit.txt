Integrit configuration files can make use of variable substitution in a way 
Tiger cannot make use of in the current Tiger version. Please supply a custom
configuration file using Tiger_Run_AIDE_CFG_OVERRIDE and/or make sure 
no variable substitution is used in the Integrit configuration file.
%integ003w
Integrit detected changes in filesystem integrity. This line is only the 
summary.
%integ003w
Integrit detected, by checking against the files' the attributes in the 
database, the file has changed. "Benign" actions, like accessing a file 
(remember directories are files too) may have changed it, but it may be part 
of a breach of security. Please investigate.
%integ004w
Integrit detected, by checking against the files' the attributes in the 
database, the file has been removed. "Benign" configuration errors of the 
database settings may lead to incorporation and checking of for instance 
temporary files. Uninstalling software and related files may lead to the 
same result when the database was not upgraded before this check.
If the removed file was not a temporary file and not part of legitimately
uninstalled software, it may have been used in a breach of security.
Please investigate.
%integ005w
Integrit detected, by checking file against the database, the file was 
not part of the database. "Benign" actions like installing software and 
related files or changes in the configuration file may lead to this result 
when the database was not upgraded before this check. If the removed file 
was not part of legitimately installed software, it may be in use in a 
breach of security. 
Please investigate.
